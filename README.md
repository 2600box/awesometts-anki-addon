This addon went through a period of being unmaintained in 2019/2020, as a result, a lot of forks appeared with different functionality. In 2020/06, we are doing a push to unify the code base. Service-specific pull requests should be approved quickly. We've implemented automated testing which should allow quickly validading code changes.
